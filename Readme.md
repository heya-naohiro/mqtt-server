> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš§ This repository is for understanding the handling of MQTT and tokio, and experimental. It is a work in progress.

## architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    client["mqtt client"] <-- MQTT --> MQTTServer
    User <-- gRPC Publish/Streaming --> MQTTServer
    subgraph server
        direction BT 
        MQTTServer --> DB[(Database)]
    end
```

- The user can communicate with the server via gRPC and publish packets to the devices.

- The user can receive packets published by the devices through gRPC server streaming via the server.

- Pub/Sub communication between devices and the server via MQTT.

- The server utilizes tokio's green threads to concurrently handle communication with multiple devices.

- I am currently only implementing QoS0 / MQTTv3.1
